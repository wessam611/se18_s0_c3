# Rise Against - Prayer Of The

<p align="center">
  Warm yourself by the fire, son,
  <br />
  And the morning will come soon.
  <br />
  I'll tell you stories of a better time,
  <br />
  In a place that we once knew.

  <br /><br />

  Before we packed our
  <br />
  And left all this behind us in the dust,
  <br />
  We had a place that we could call home,
  <br />
  And a life no one could touch.

  <br /><br />

  Don't hold me up now,
  <br />
  I can stand my own ground,
  <br />
  I don't need your help now,
  <br />
  You will let me down, down, down!

  <br /><br />

  Don't hold me up now,
  <br />
  I can stand my own ground,
  <br />
  I don't need your help now,
  <br />
  You will let me down, down, down!

  <br /><br />

  Down!

  <br /><br />

  We are the angry and the desperate,
  <br />
  The hungry, and the cold,
  <br />
  We are the ones who kept quiet,
  <br />
  And always did what we were told.

  <br /><br />

  But we've been sweating while you slept so calm,
  <br />
  In the safety of your home.
  <br />
  We've been pulling out the nails that hold up
  <br />
  Everything you've known.

  <br /><br />

  Don't hold me up now,
  <br />
  I can stand my own ground,
  <br />
  I don't need your help now,
  <br />
  You will let me down, down, down!

  <br /><br />

  Don't hold me up now,
  <br />
  I can stand my own ground,
  <br />
  I don't need your help now,
  <br />
  You will let me down, down, down!

  <br /><br />

  So open your eyes child,
  <br />
  Let's be on our way.
  <br />
  Broken windows and ashes
  <br />
  Are guiding the way.

  <br /><br />

  Keep quiet no longer,
  <br />
  We'll sing through the day,
  <br />
  Of the lives that we've lost,
  <br />
  And the lives we've reclaimed.

  <br /><br />

  Go!

  <br /><br />

  Don't hold me up now,
  <br />
  I can stand my own ground,
  <br />
  I don't need your help now,
  <br />
  You will let me down, down, down!

  <br /><br />

  Don't hold me up now,
  <br />
  I can stand my own ground,
  <br />
  I don't need your help now,
  <br />
  You will let me down, down, down!

  <br /><br />

  Don't hold me up...
  <br />
  (I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
  <br />
  Don't hold me up...
  <br />
  (I don't need your help)
  <br />
  No! No! No!
  <br />
  Don't hold me up!
  <br />
  (I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
  <br />
  Don't hold me up!
  <br />
  (I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
  <br />
  Don't let me down, down, down, down, down!
