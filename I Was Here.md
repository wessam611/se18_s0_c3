# Beyonc√© - I Was Here

<p style="text-align: center;">
  I wanna leave my footprints on the sands of time
  <br />
  Know there was something that, meant something that I left behind
  <br />
  When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets
  <br />
  Leave something to remember, so they won't forget
  <br /><br />
  I was here
  <br />
  I lived, I loved
  <br />
  I was here
  <br />
  I did, I've done everything that I wanted
  <br />
  And it was more than I thought it would be
  <br />
  I will leave my mark so everyone will know
  <br />
  I was here
  <br /><br />
  I wanna say I lived each day, until I die
  <br />
  And know that I meant something in somebody's life
  <br />
  The hearts I have touched will be the proof that I leave
  <br />
  That I made a difference, and this world will see
  <br /><br />
  I was
  <br />
  I lived, I loved
  <br />
  I was here
  <br />
  I did, I've done everything that I wanted
  <br />
  And it was more than I thought it would be
  <br />
  I will leave my mark so everyone will know
  <br /><br />
  I was here
  <br />
  I lived, I loved
  <br />
  I was here
  <br />
  I did, I've done everything that I wanted
  <br />
  And it was more than I thought it would be
  <br />
  I will leave my mark so everyone will know
  <br />
  I was here
  <br /><br />
  I just want them to know
  <br />
  That I gave my all, did my best
  <br />
  Brought someone some happiness
  <br />
  Left this world a little better just because
  <br /><br />
  I was here
  <br /><br />
  I was here
  <br />
  I lived, I loved
  <br />
  I was here
  <br />
  I did, I've done everything that I wanted
  <br />
  And it was more than I thought it would be
  <br />
  I wanna leave my mark so everyone will know
  <br /><br />
  I was here
  <br />
  I lived (I lived), I loved
  <br />
  I was here
  <br />
  I did (I did), I've done
  <br />
  I was here
  <br />
  I lived (I lived), I loved (I loved)
  <br />
  I was here (oh)
  <br />
  I did, I've done
  <br /><br />
  I was here
